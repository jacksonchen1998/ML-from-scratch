# ML-from-scratch

This repository is a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in Python.

Every algorithm has three parts:
- Using the algorithm to solve a problem with libraries
- Using the algorithm to solve a problem without libraries (from scratch)
- Using the algorithm to solve a real-world problem
